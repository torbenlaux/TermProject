# About the Project
This project follows the flow of analyzing data from the 2021 census data on trips to work. I am comparing three Canadian Census Metropolitan Area or CMAs, Montreal, Toronto and Greater Vancouver Area to see which CMA has the highest shares of active modes of transportation.
I have a made graphs to represent my work and finding as these show a lot of information. I enjoy spreadsheets and graphs a lot and wanted to find ways of exploring more options. I hope you enjoy, and happy Summer VACATION!
